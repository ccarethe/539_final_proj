                    <p><span class="highlight">I have read this book twice before. Everytime, I am entertained.</span> The novel follows Patroclus as he starts his new life in Phthia after a tragedy. He is demoted from the title of prince and forced to train for the King of Phthia's army. Yet, his fate brightens when he meets and forms a deep relationship with the Prince of Phthia, Achilles. Madeline Miller is a fantastic storyteller. Each chapter reads fluidly - I always find myself having a difficult time putting down this book!</p>

                    <p>I thought this book was entertaining. The story covers multiple characters from their childhood through their older adulthood years. There are themes of adventure, tragedy, romance, and forgiveness. I was overcome to see how one's life can change drastically over the course of time. I will definitely read this again in the future.</p>

                    <p>I wasn't interested in the current day portion of the novel. I thought it picked up when it talked about Youngman's early years during and after the Korean war. I thought the SANUS stuff was weird.</p>

                    <p>This book was very entertaining. I enjoyed learning about each women's experiences with their sexuality. I felt empowered to see how has each women grew, they were able to learn more about themselves and their needs.</p>
